It is the worlds most famous equation, but what does it really mean? -Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.- On the most basic level, the equation says that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing.It is the most using formula in Physics"},{"id":2,"img":"https://png.pngtree.com/thumb_back/fh260/background/20190828/pngtree-chemistry-lab-equipment-design-background-image_307726.jpg","explanation":"Chemistry  deals with the properties, composition, and structure of elements and compounds, how they can change, and the energy that is released or absorbed when they change and this images with many kinds of Testtube and withsome Chemical..This is the labratory part of Chemistry seen we have seen normally."},{"id":3,"img":"https://www.microscopemaster.com/images/nucleusdiagram.png","explanation":"The nucleus controls and regulates the activities of the cell (e.g., growth and metabolism) and carries the genes, structures that contain the hereditary information. Nucleoli are small bodies often seen within the nucleus. The gel-like matrix in which the nuclear components are suspended is the nucleoplasm."},{"id":4,"img":"https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/parent-functions.png","explanation":"A parent function is the simplest function that still satisfies the definition of a certain type of function. For example, when we think of the linear functions which make up a family of functions, the parent function would be y = x. This is the simplest linear function."}]
